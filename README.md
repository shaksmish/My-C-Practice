# My-C-Practice

Assortment of C Programs I wrote During my 3rd Semester **Data Structres and Algorithms** Course.

*All the programs were written on Ubuntu and run using GCC Compiler.*
**Most of them have Sufficient Comments for Understanding the code.**

The Repo has 5 folders listed below with details :
### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms
Contains Programs which I wrote as a part of my course , It includes with their associated functions like *push , pop* etc
* Implementation of stack using array ,Link list and queue
* Implementation of  linked list
* Implementaion of queue
* Implementaion of weighted and unweighted graph adjacency matrix
* Binary Search Tree.

### 2. Fun but Tough
These are the programs that I wrote just for the heck of it and I am quite proud of some of them
+ **Balancer** : This program takes input string containing of  *parenthesis* ( closed and open )  and tells us whether the parenthesis are balanced or not. Uses *stack*.
+ **Alpha Count** (*Run this, it's Cool*) : Enter a text file in arguement and it will give you a horizontal histogram of the frequency of  alphabets . See code for demo.
+ **Base Converter** : Enter a number in decimal and a target  base and output will be the converted number in target base. *Pretty Cool Huh!!*

### 3. K and R Solutions
If you have not heard of K&R and you are a computer undergrad then you better go and google it .
Here is the link [Buy it here](http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8120305965/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&creativeASIN=8120305965&linkCode=as2&tag=gbuonline00-21) , Written by guys who ceated **C**.
This folder contains solutions to some of the problems of 1st chapter.

### 4. Simple Algo
This folder contains basic sorting programs such as **binary** and **bubble** sort .It also has Searching Programs  and some counting programs which count white spaces ,newlines and tabs.

### 5. Basics
This has very basic level programs of matrix , pattern printing,factorial etc.
